- how to interpolate between 2 timeseries.
    - we tried nearest
        - CON: 
            - lose labels timepost
            - maybe take a lebels that is very far from the correct one
- score emo: with ghieher psotive or magnitude of z.wcore
- can you give us some intial grpah with out connecitvyt (i.e 414 nodes)
- why need to learn the grpah, when we can use GAT???
- maybe take only the timepoints that have a constant label for a long time (exclude borders)??
-is it corrct how we intiilaize node weights
- size of the grpahs is areund 4M each one --> 4 * 13 * 30 * 300
- do we want to validate with  
    - crossvalidation(use all dataset)
    - set apart a rel never seen test set



IDEAS
- nodes features
    - single fmri value
    - frmi values in a past window, weighted with a kerner
    - specific metric
        - std
        - means
        - cov along space
- connectivity (initial graph)
    - FC
        - whole timeseries
        - based short past window
    - Fubctional network
    - score
    - clique
- y labels
    - regression
    - classification
        - single class
            - take max score
        - multi class   
            - take above thr (one hot encode) --> (put 1 if scores above 2std)
- interpretation
    - not best nodes, but best network
