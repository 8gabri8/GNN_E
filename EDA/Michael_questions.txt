- how to interpolate between 2 timeseries.
    - we tried nearest
        - CON: 
            - lose labels timepost
            - maybe take a lebels that is very far from the correct one
- score emo: with ghieher psotive or magnitude of z.wcore
- can you give us some intial grpah with out connecitvyt (i.e 414 nodes)
- why need to learn the grpah, when we can use GAT???
- maybe take only the timepoints that have a constant label for a long time (exclude borders)??
-is it corrct how we intiilaize node weights
- size of the grpahs is areund 4M each one --> 4 * 13 * 30 * 300
- do we want to validate with  
    - crossvalidation(use all dataset)
    - set apart a rel never seen test set

- how to split train test --> we used entropy
- env with alrey cirret veriosn pythrich
-QUESTION: how can we split horizontally (train/test) without information leakage. If we use a window to calculate the node features, for sure the nodes on the border will have info thaat comes form the other set
